# Introduction

This project music app provides the functions that listening online musics, downloading a music from remote server,
checking top charts for artists or tracks or albums in this week, and searching a music for yourself. Basically, it's a
demo app but all the basic functions we provide.

Talking is wasting time XD Let's just see the Demo.

# Data Source

Explore Function - All tracks, artists, photos data comes from [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) . It lets me be able to
